### Covid-19 Tracker

**What does it do?**
*This application was designed to visualize the number of Covid-19 cases throughout the world. As developers, the best we can do is build something which will help the people visualize any given situation. This application does just that. It shows the total number of cases, number of recovered cases (currently the 3rd party api is not returning this value so you'll see it as 0) and the number of fatalities due to Covid-19.*

#### Tech Stack
*My tech stack of choice for this project was **ReactJS** with **Material UI**. The charts are generated using a react library called **react-chartjs-2**.*

#### Current Version and Future plans
*Currently it does the job. You can see the Global data as well drill down by country to see the how each one is doing. For global data, I am using a line chart to display the data and for countries, I am using a bar graph. I am searching for alternate 3rd party APIs at the moment which will supply me with all the necessary data. The application is hosted using GitHub Pages on [https://supratikr.github.io/covid-tracker/](https://supratikr.github.io/covid-tracker/)*
